We help companies frustrated by issues on the production floor, concerned about the time SIGMASOFT® Virtual Molding technology is a unique approach in the injection molding industry. The software was created to evaluate and optimize processes and molds, increasing efficiency, productivity and part quality. SIGMASOFT® Virtual Molding's approach is to consider all the components of the mold with their specific physical and thermal properties. Then, processing conditions are used and multiple consecutive cycles are reproduced virtually, representing what happens in the molding machine during the manufacturing process. With SIGMASOFT® Virtual Molding, this is done in the virtual world, accurately reflecting what will happen in the real world. This way, the same conditions that are found on the production floor are replicated virtually. Mold iterations and injection trials are performed independently, freeing up machine occupation, machine hours and personnel availability, while increasing safety, quality and reliability and reducing costs. SIGMASOFT® Virtual Molding is a valued communication tool to use between customers and suppliers, consequently reducing development time and minimizing risk. Since troubleshooting is done virtually, utilizing effective planning and optimization of the injection molding process in parallel to the geometry design and mold development, real world troubleshooting is greatly reduced or even eliminated once actual production is ready to begin.

Our RedCircle Ad Platform (RAP) enables brands to launch campaigns quickly & at scale. Before the Ranger Creed is recited by a formation of Rangers at any ceremony, you will always here the Narrator say this: ""Will all Ranger Past and Present please join us as we recite the Ranger Creed""? Every Ranger will stand and as they say those six stanza's they are transformed back to a time when they had the pleasure and burden of this brotherhood. That feeling is hard to describe, however it is one that never leaves you. It's a connection that spans the globe and can be reignited when you hear the phrase: ""hey Ranger what battalion you from"". Amongst this formation there are Rangers that stand out, they are Legends of this elite organization and when their names are spoken people instantly have a story and for a moment relive it. Legends of the 75th Podcast wants to capture that feeling and those stories. We want to ensure that these legends triumphs and sacrifices never fade away. So, sit back with your favorite adult beverage and listen to the stories from the ""Legends of the 75th"".","Technology Insights Settings

Our mission is to enable transformative change in global enterprises through automated, financed credit programs. Simplicity is our watchword, because we've found that eliminating the unnecessary in business-to-business transactions is in the best interest of our customers, our lenders, and the people they serve. We believe that A/R automation will continue to march forward toward automated invoice financing – especially for channels (eCommerce), markets (international) or customers (long-tail) where a hands-off approach makes more sense and generates and maximizes ROI for the enterprise.","Technology Insights Settings

There is an abundance of positions chasing a smaller pool of qualified engineers. Lacking experienced recruiters and proven hiring processes, companies find themselves unable to fill critical positions, while incurring expensive delays in releasing new and improved products and services, hurting their bottom line. We offer informative recruiting services to successfully fill a client's technical positions in a timely fashion, with our proven retained search processes and attention to rich, ongoing dialog with our clients. Our reasonable fees and quality of engineers we place--which typically are promoted can keep your development project timetables & costs on target while increasing your firm's valuation. Perhaps it's time to shift your firm's recruiting dependency on low cost contingency search firms that cost you a bundle, with unsuccessful hires. We suggest you rearm your recruiting methods and turn it into a strategic advantage. Contact us to learn first-hand how we are successfully conducting intensive technical searches, including valuable but time-consuming technical screening. Our engineering and software development hires have benefited the likes of Walmart's E-Commerce group in Brisbane CA, Varian NMR's group in Walnut Creek CA, Ineos Olefins & Polymers plant and corporate facilities in Carson CA and League City TX, along with Sephora's IT mobile and interactive development group in San Francisco CA. Our client placements have crossed America, meeting client regional needs. You are welcome to contact us for a complimentary half-hour assessment of your current hiring challenges, via info@informativerecruiting.com, or via phone: 925.833.8714","Technology Insights Settings

Praktio uniquely brings together experience and expertise in transactional law and experiential teaching, with a software platform tailor-made for producing interactive digital training around documents. Founded in 2014 by a Michigan Law professor looking for a better way for clinic students to learn the language of contracts, Praktio is an innovative provider of modern training—practical, interactive, self-paced, online—for reading, writing, and otherwise working with documents in realistic, professional contexts (for example, reviewing, drafting, and negotiating contracts). Praktio training incorporates best practices from learning science (such as frameworks, realistic application, spaced repetition, deliberate practice, and immediate feedback). Praktio uses real-world documents annotated to draw out lessons and interactive exercises that put the learner in realistic scenarios where they complete realistic activities, with immediate feedback every step of the way. Now, law firms use Praktio to train their lawyers and staff with digital training that is practical, interactive, self-paced, and online. And increasingly, individual lawyers, legal staff, and business people (procurement, sales, contract managers, etc.) are doing the same.","Technology Insights Settings

Panelists have included such notables as David Petraeus, Susan Rice, John Kerry, Condoleezza Rice, Michael Steele, Donna Brazile, John Kasich, Julian Castro and Larry Kudlow, exploring issues ranging from race and income inequality to foreign policy.

WAIR is a one of a kind solution and is built atop the world's largest database of 3D body scans. WAIR is inventing Sizeless Commerce. Shoppers hate using traditional sizing tools, such as size charts, model dimensions, and size based reviews. In fact, 35% of abandoned carts are due to size confusion and 72% of all returns are for size and fit reasons. WAIR developed a product and size recommendation solution where we predict the body dimensions of the shoppers and align them with the a custom recommendation algorithm built for each product. It is so powerful, that new shoppers that use WAIR convert 700% higher than those that use a size chart. Those same shoppers tend to return their products for size and fit reasons 20% less. WAIR also collects powerful data on the shoppers journey, which is fed back to the operating teams to help with product design, inventory management, and customer support.","Technology Insights Settings

This geospatial solution also acts as an all-inclusive digital storage space for blueprints, as-built drawings, maintenance logs, permits, and more. Historically, facility managers have only seen pieces of their infrastructure at a time. SiteMap is a single application that allows a user to see the big picture while still accessing specific infrastructure attributes, such as utility line depth, length, type, and other contextual information. Through SiteMap's Map Viewer and Digital Plan Room, users have complete control over their facilities' information. We have created this platform from the ground up to be intuitive and understandable to anyone who chooses to use it. No prior experience is required to immediately start viewing, editing, and sharing your facility information. Perhaps most importantly, SiteMap is powered by GPRS. GPRS is the nation's largest private utility locating company with the most comprehensive utility map data. When GPRS performs a utility locate, concrete scan, leak detection, or video pipe inspection, we deliver high-quality maps to our users. SiteMap will enable facilities to maintain live access to those previously generated maps while giving them a single place to manage that data. SiteMap provides the tools to make your life simpler.","Technology Insights Settings

In Silicon Valley, founders with customer-centric experience often get overshadowed in a place where engineers are revered for their ability to design, code and build new technologies. The PocketBuildings advantage? Our founders listened to hundreds of real estate professionals (brokers, landlords, tenants, architects, engineers and builders) to understand their challenges when storing, viewing and sharing building files. They knew solving the problem wouldn't be easy so they built a great team of talented designers, brilliant developers and advisors who were experts in product, technology and commercial real estate.

Whether it's a gift or for yourself these bat mugs are a home run! 100% Money Back Guarantee. Made in the USA. Officially Licensed. Made from Solid Wood. Dugout Mugs® are baseball bat drinking mugs, and our unique products have quickly become some of the most popular premium gifted items in the baseball world and the corporate gifting space! We're honored to be the leader in our space and pride ourselves on being the ONLY COMPANY of our kind. Whether it be our officially licensed Major League Baseball line, or custom logo items such as bat handle shot glasses, bottle openers, mugs, tumblers, etc., our lineup is guaranteed to knock it out of the park every time! The company, which is spearheaded by business veteran and owner Kris Dehnert, boasts nearly $50,000,000 in sales since 2017, 3 consecutive INC. 5000 placements, and has been featured on FOX and Friends, CBS Saturday Morning, The View, The TODAY Show, and more. Why is it called the Dugout Mug? Back in 2014 while coaching at Florida Tech, Randall Thompson (the inventor of the very first bat mug, and founder of Dugout Mugs®) was sitting in the dugout and listening to the hitting coach tell the guys to ""FOCUS ON THE HANDS."" To emphasize his point, the coach cut off the top of a baseball bat and left the barrel sitting on the bench… BOOM! The idea hit Randall like a 12th inning walk-off, ""I could definitely drink from a bat!"" he said to himself… The rest is history!","Technology Insights Settings

Founded by Dr. Elizabeth Ruzzo, adyn is helping people find birth control without side effects based on a person's genetic risk and hormone profile. Despite the 47M birth control users in the US, virtually no studies examine the biological factors that explain why individuals respond differently to a given contraceptive method. Launched in May 2022, The Birth Control Test is the first test designed to prevent birth control side effects. While we are improving the birth control experience, we are also committed to closing the gender health gap. By partnering with individuals, adyn leverages personal preference, medical history, and biological data to proactively help every (unique) body select the most desirable birth control option – with the least dangerous side effects. Our vision is to be earth's most inclusive and patient-centric personalized medicine company. When a person uses The Birth Control Test, they can opt in as an anonymous research participant to help close these research gaps. This means you can simultaneously find the right birth control for your body, while helping others do the same.","Technology Insights Settings

Together, we’ll bring map-based capabilities to the Procore platform, providing valuable location intelligence to the construction industry. At Unearth, we've built mobile software – OnePlace – that connects the office, trailer, and field on a simple yet powerful map. Contractors lose precious hours in the search for jobsite information. Photos get dumped in folders, hundreds of plan sheets are stuffed in lists, and you're left trying to communicate these files over a maze of text, email, and clunky apps. With OnePlace, you can visualize the entirety of your project, track progress in real time, and collaborate with crews on the jobsite, on any device. Empty your folders and geolocate everything against a comprehensive map: photos, drawings, documents, drone surveys, GIS, and more. Seeing everything in context makes it easy to find the information you need, so you can get the job done fast. From site planning to field operations, OnePlace has cut the time required by inspections, QA/QC, reporting, data tracking, and issue resolution by over 50% for major owners and contractors. See how OnePlace can save hours in your week with a 30-day free trial.","Technology Insights Settings

Since the start of the Covid-19 Pandemic in March 2020, our economy has taken a drastic turn. From thousands of businesses being forced to shut down, to labor shortages causing a global supply-chain nightmare, businesses are struggling to both get rid of and buy furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E). As a result, businesses are left having to throw away perfectly functional equipment, causing our landfills to fill up even more rapidly, and leaving new businesses without the resources they need to function. With Bulkk's innovative platform, businesses who need to get rid of FF&E, whether they are shutting down, moving, or don't need their equipment for any reason, can now list their items for other businesses to purchase. Not only does this help businesses get their equipment off their back, but it enables new businesses to have easy access to discounted materials and stops perfectly good FF&E from going to landfills. Our team is dedicated to helping your business either liquidate FF&E or connect you with other businesses' equipment. Let's work together and help solve an urgent global supply chain issue, reduce waste, and ultimately increase sustainable business practices.","Technology Insights Settings

Call for a no cost, no obligation tax debt consultation. I am a trusted and reliable CPA who solves IRS problems from the comfort of your home. I help people have a more positive experience with the IRS and pay their back taxes by getting tax relief with offers in compromise and IRS tax payment plans that have affordable monthly payments. I specialize in helping taxpayers with IRS and state tax difficulties. My knowledge has shown that the majority of people who owe back taxes are decent individuals who have not received good advice. This is the sort of people and businesses across the nation that I love to fight for in providing tax relief or tax resolution. I understand what it takes to obtain honest back tax relief according to the law and how to deal with the IRS and the Florida Department of Revenue for a fair tax settlement. I am a prominent figure in the industry, with offices in Saint Augustine, Jacksonville and Destin, Florida. Hundreds of good folks have benefited from my experience resolving IRS and State of Florida tax issues. Obtaining tax relief allows you to regain financial independence. This provides you comfort and a good night's sleep. So, does it not make sense to: 1) Clean everything up by accessing your IRS records & insuring nothing else is in the IRS collection pipeline. 2) Get a grip on what you are doing to manage your current accounting and tax responsibilities while making sure that any OIC or Installment agreement takes your current tax obligations into account. 3) Plan for your future tax obligations and reduce them via proactive tax-planning 101 measures. I start with a free evaluation so call me toll free at 844-888-1040 TODAY and sleep much better TONIGHT! Let's connect and if you are interested, we can schedule a time to get to know each other.","Technology Insights Settings
