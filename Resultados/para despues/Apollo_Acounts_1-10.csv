1 Source Medicine,9.0,"Dallas, Texas",E-learning,https://app.apollo.io/#/organizations/61af70ac1b1153008c0ab9db,"At 1SM, we pair our students with 525+ scoring experts to personalize every step of the MCAT prep process, from initial content review through UWorld and AAMC material. Why should pre-med students choose 1SM for there MCAT prep? Why not choose one of the industry's corporate giants? 1. We only hire 525+ scorers: Most companies in the industry advertise 95th percentile (~518) instructors & tutors. While 518 is a great score, it has been our experience that even most 99th percentile (521) scorers come up short when asked to teach ""off script,"" which limits the scope of instruction available. 2. Higher quality at a fraction of the price: We charge far less than the preeminent names in the MCAT prep industry. Most companies that offer packages comparable to ours will charge DOUBLE what we're asking, not to mention the massive gap in quality already discussed! 3. Emphasis on individualization: Unlike the ""one size fits all"" programs pedaled by our corporate competitors, every aspect of the 1SM approach is fully personalized to optimally address the needs of each individual student. 4. We've partnered with U-World to provide the highest quality MCAT question bank on the market, completely free. For the added price of $0.00, you will receive 90-days of access to U-World's 2,300+ questions. 5. Efficient Prep Promise: It's criminal to charge for the minutes of pleasantries beginning & ending meetings. Nevermind any windows in which the instructor makes and corrects an error. That is why our students will NEVER be charged for the full duration of any given meeting. Per testimonials from former students, we tend to over-correct substantially. 6. Rescheduling Insurance: Yet another amenity not offered by our competitors, this perk is exactly what it appears to be. We're so supremely confident in our ability to guide you through the MCAT prep process that we will pay for the rescheduling fee if you aren't ready to take the test when the time comes! 7. Receive up to $600 in credit (exact amount depends on package purchased) toward our Application Aid services when you work with us on your MCAT!","Technology Insights Settings

We would love to help! Our process all begins with a completely free assessment. As the oldest grandchild I always had a ""special fondness"" for my grandparents and spent tons of time with them. Both my grandfather's were WWII veterans and as a child I was confident that they could fix anything with a little Duck Tape and ingenuity. In 2001 I was looking for a caregiver for my grandmother, who had Alzheimer's and my grandfather who had Dementia. I realized that there was a huge need for this service in a highly fragmented marketplace. With my theology background I believed it was important to ""honor your parents (and grandparents)"" and decided to roll up my sleeves and do something to make the last few years of a seniors lives some of their best. Today 1776 Senior care has a great team of caregivers and care managers that support families that want to ""declare their independence"" and continue to live in their own home.

1908 Advisors,3.0,"Jonesboro, Georgia",Financial Services,https://app.apollo.io/#/organizations/5a9f3f39a6da98d94d954ec9,"Life settlements for top wealth advisors and insurance professionals committed to the highest standard of client care and transparent price discovery. As private equity buyers of in-force life insurance for seven years before founding 1908 in 2016, it is clear to us that the incentive structure and level of fees - not to mention the absence of objective, professional wealth management advice to navigate the transaction - that characterize the conventional broker market levy a wholly unreasonable tax on policy owners, your clients. It encourages bad behavior that has negative psychic and economic implications for your clients, whether in the intermediated channel with a brokers than charges >30% of the value of the transaction in often misleadlingly-described commissions or in the direct channel, with thise firms that advertise on TV. So, with a fundamentally different philosophy that underlies everything we do, we undertook to deliver a materially differentiated and better service for fiduciary and fiduciary-minded advisors of HNW clients to ensure that you can deliver a life settlement solution worthy of your reputation and standards.","Technology Insights Settings

They are often the first to arrive at the scene of a disaster, accident, or crime, and they are responsible for providing critical care and support to those in need. However, constant exposure to trauma and stress can take a toll on their mental health, leading to conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.

Civilian, Law Enforcement and Military gear and accessories. Body armor, police body vest, plate carriers, gloves, apparel, underwear, k-9 gear, dog harnesses and accessories. 221B Tactical gets its name from Scottish author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. 221B Baker Street was where he lived with his sidekick Dr.Watson and used his proficiency with observation, science, and logical reasoning to his investigation. We follow his example in creating products and serving our customers. All our products are designed and vetted by 13 year retired NJ Patrolman, Suresh Madhavan. Suresh encountered all kinds of situations on the job and he coupled his ""street knowledge"" with textile and apparel veterans, Brad Pedell and Shawn Lee. Together they created 221B Tactical in 2014 and today the organization offers a complete line of essential, superior products designed for first responders worldwide. ANYONE can purchase from 221B Tactical. Most of its products are also used by outdoors enthusiasts, industrial workers, and additionally by civilians from all walks of life. 221B's policy is to insist upon the satisfaction of its customers. If for any reason within 30 days of purchase a customer is dissatisfied, 221B Tactical insists for that customer to request to return for a refund. As Sherlock Holmes would say, ""Eliminate the Impossible."" That's what 221B Tactical strives to do! After all, ""it's elementary!""","Technology Insights Settings

Our end-to-end technology (Software, Manufacturing, and Logistics) enables a creator to design without limits using our 3D Design Studio, to express creativity on apparel never possible before, and to manufacture and deliver product directly to customers on-demand. We are mission focused and very product centric. We deeply believe in our product (software and soft goods) with maniacal attention to detail and quality. Today, no scalable high quality and cost-effective solution exists for creators to monetize their popularity outside of top funnel platforms. On-demand merch platforms exist, but typically they're low quality and limited in design. The creator economy is growing rapidly. Roughly $150B in sales with 200M Creators and 500M Passion Economy Users. Yet 90% of these creators have been unable to earn a livable income. 23point5 is here to change that.","Technology Insights Settings

It takes a myriad of professionals to turn this wheel we call the music business: radio air personalities, tour managers, record label insiders, specialists in television programming, directors of live events and publicists who provide artists with the exposure needed to keep the wheel in motion. Knowledge is power, and executive/entrepreneur Jeremy Westby is the power behind 2911 Enterprises. Westby is the rare individual whose twenty-five years of experience in the music industry champions each of those arenas‚Äîon a multi genre level in all realms. After all, how many people can say they've worked side by side with Megadeth, Meat Loaf, Micheal W. Smith and Dolly Parton? Westby can. ""I want 2911 to be a change agent in the world: in entertainment, sports, politics, and in many different areas, because I think the world needs to hear good messages,"" says Westby. ""The world needs healing and inspiration, and if there is a way I can go about my day and provide inspiration, healing, hope, and change, I want to do that."" As President & CEO of 2911 Media, Westby continues a working relationship with Country Music Hall of Famers The Oak Ridge Boys that began when he was in college. He also represents country legends Charley Pride, Lee Greenwood, Lacy J. Dalton, and Janie Fricke, pop/rock icons Wanda Jackson, Don McLean and Sam Moore, newcomers Lee Gantt, Sara Spicer, JD Shelburne and Patrick James, and acclaimed musicians Tim Atwood and Kyle Dillingham, among others. ""I created 2911 to be a vehicle for change in the world for the right reasons,"" says Westby, who named the company after his favorite, namesake Bible verse, Jeremiah 29:11 -- For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.","Technology Insights Settings

We did a lot of research and decided that Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and the increasing availability of the Internet meant that the old laptop and server business model were not the most cost-effective for professionals and that's where 2BMobile comes in. In 2013 we sold the SaaS business and though we are still big supporters of remote working which you find in our blog posting we shifted to digital marketing as the main mission of 2BMobile. We learned a lot about the challenges that technical/engineering companies have in developing and executing their go-to-market plans. Compound the go-to-marketing with the changes that have occurred with digital marketing. 2BMobile engineers great marketing plans for our clients that enable increased sales and profitability. Have conservation with us. Let's see if we can help your business.","Technology Insights Settings

We created 2DA with the vision to help commodity supply & trading organizations unlock their true potential. Our company was inspired by the realization that while the industry was amassing huge amounts of data, it lacked the tools to properly harness it. With this in mind, we began working with forward-thinking organizations in downstream oil, crafting a solution around their biggest data challenges. The result is BAYZYEN - the world's first cloud-based operational planning & optimization app built specifically and solely for oil value chains. 2DA was started in 2016 by former traders and consultants but has since grown to include operations researchers, data hunters, scientists and developers. Being as passionate about tech as we are about oil, we've built BAYZYEN using cutting-edge components to create a solution that is both flexible and scalable. While our company has grown, we still keep the same focus on industry collaboration that we've had since day one. By continuously testing and gathering feedback about the app, we uncover new ways to serve the people that use it every day. The days of longing for the ""luxury"" of true data insights in downstream oil are over. Welcome to the new industry standard.","Technology Insights Settings

If you struggle with conflict resolution and the negative impact of festering wedges then let us, at 34th Street Consulting show you the right tools to use in order to get you, your team, and the company back to where it want to be-productive, efficient and harmonious. With over 20 years of experience, our team is led by Gerry Preciado, a recovering attorney who realized that to truly help his clients he needed to develop a method for empowering them to positively respond to conflict instead of letting conflict negatively define them. Conflict is universal and leads to positive or negative outcomes. Failing to invest in developing the skills to navigate conflict is a missed opportunity for individuals and organizations to experience effective, productive, and fulfilling relationships. We help teams defined by conflict go from dysfunctional, unproductive, and underachieving to harmonious, effective and skilled at navigating future conflict. We empower your team with the skills and knowledge to identify problem behaviors, resolve them, and navigate conflict in the future. We then build upon that foundation to cultivate sustained positive change by training your team in harassment prevention, effective communication, building trust, and more.","Technology Insights Settings

3RM.co,7.0,"San Francisco, California",Information Technology & Services,https://app.apollo.io/#/organizations/63c618f624acd400e35b17f7,"Helping Web3 work together. Ditch the overwhelming Telegram inbox for a team-wide CRM that helps you become more productive and close more deals, for free. The future of the internet is focused on user ownership. The vision of this change is inspired by true decentralization of authority and autonomy to the users instead of the companies. This has mostly been seen through the democratization of decision the making of large companies by enabling their users to vote on decisions and control the value that they create for the applications that they use online. Examples of this can be seen in the new wave of applications that are built to enable this behavior change. Decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), decentralized applications (dApps), and other products are built that embody these principles. Our belief is that if we are able to build technology that enables the infrastructure that is currently being built, we will unlock the true potential of the technology and behavior change for the masses. 3RM's vision is to create tooling that allows any participant in web3 to be able to meaningfully contribute to their relationships. Whether it's sales, marketing, recruiting, or customer success we are building tooling that enables all of these roles to succeed. We do this by focusing on how you acquire, manage, and support the growth of these relationships. We are building tooling that truly allows decentralized relationships to blossom without being tracked, data sold off, or any other malpractices that currently plague web2. We are making the business-enablement layer of web3.","Technology Insights Settings

Utilizing an innovative preferred equity financing structure combining features of debt + equity, 3SPOKE invests in the next generation of visionary and disruptive global companies. These innovative companies continue to mature and grow larger and more valuable while remaining privately held, creating enormous pent-up demand for liquidity from their stakeholders. 3SPOKE's mission is to provide balanced liquidity solutions for this dynamic ecosystem, while providing investors access to venture and growth equity no longer easily accessible through the public markets and represented by an extremely large and growing opportunity set. 3SPOKE offers its asset owners a highly favorable form of liquidity that allows them to continue to participate in future growth in value, without locking in current market discounts or taxes, or requiring a change in control; and offers investors a risk-mitigated approach to invest in the most successful private companies and portfolios containing them, while taking execution rather than concept risk, and benefiting from an asymmetric risk-return profile.","Technology Insights Settings

FOUR18 Intelligence provides cybersecurity's only scalable solution to the experience gap that blocks hopeful and developing cyber analysts from entering the field and employers from escaping the revolving door of the talent crisis. In only 7 weeks part-time the company's live-action Micro-Apprenticeship program gives learners the hands-on and critical thinking skills, teamwork, passion for cyber defense and on-the-job experience that makes them job-ready and sought-after by employers. The key is FOUR18's novel DEF3NSE live threat hunting and collaboration platform where analysts solve a highly curated and limitless stream of live online threats using real tools and on-demand coaching from frontline cybersecurity analyst practitioners assisted by AI. This is NOT another range or sim. This is live-fire and real-world. Our learners tackle exactly the same campaigns of the pros (on the same day!) and go straight to analyst jobs earning $70,000 and higher. They come from all backgrounds: urban, remote rural, refugees, veterans and incumbent workers, and through FOUR18 they start work Day 1 ready to perform. Soon DEF3NSE will be going global and live-stream with the first Fight Club for cyber where hunting real attacks will become sport and hackers will become prey!","Technology Insights Settings

4C's Spray Equipment,1.0,"Carlisle, Pennsylvania",Construction,https://app.apollo.io/#/organizations/614d8d1de87cbd000146b094,"4C's Spray Equipment was founded by Mike and Jean Calaman in 1997. Mike spent many years working in the construction and roofing industry before taking on a role at Carlisle Syntec when their Fleeceback product was introduced to the industry. Once that line was up and running, Mike saw an opportunity to start 4C's Spray Equipment and spent the next 20 years working on, repairing and replacing the traditional two component machines. He also provided an important service for contractors as a source for them to rent spray equipment while theirs was being repaired. Mike spent many years working on other manufacturer's equipment. He then realized he could develop a better system that provided what contractors needed, and that would perform without the traditional breaks and common flaws that cause downtime and equipment failure. That's when the HULK (Heated, Urethane, Low-rise Adhesive, Kart) was born. 4C's is not only committed to manufacturing a superior spray rig but they deliver an outstanding customer service experience to every contractor who has added the HULK to their roofing toolbox.","Technology Insights Settings

5 Multimedia,2.0,"Newnan, Georgia",Marketing & Advertising,https://app.apollo.io/#/organizations/5a9d2ba5a6da98d97e740791,"Fastest growing digital agency in Atlanta, Georgia for SEO, Web Design and Social Media Management. 5 Multimedia is a steadily growing digital / content marketing agency that provides a company specific, expertly crafted strategy to help you hit your goals. When you become a client, we become an extension of your company, studying what you do, how you do it, to better provide you with the best strategy. Why would you choose us to be your Digital Strategy Agency? The team at 5 Multimedia has over a decade of experience in all things digital marketing, we eat, sleep and love our jobs. It just so happens that our team is made up of former collegiate athletes, which, we feel, has been the factor in us growing as a company. Athletes have a different mentality, we know the value of working as a team but also know we have to individually continue to get better to make sure our team succeeds. This is why we encourage continued education to ensure we stay up to date on the latest updates, technology, trends, techniques, etc to make sure we deliver an exceptional product to each of our clients. We are NOT in business to ""make a quick buck"", and unfortunately some companies are and don't have your best interests at heart. Our aim is to develop long term relationships with each of our clients, getting to know their business, their competition and becoming a team with them. All of our clients have loved this approach and I guess that is why they stay with us.","Technology Insights Settings

Our mission is to connect the excavation safety and damage prevention world to create open lines of communication that ultimately save lives and prevent damages. Every ESA initiative, from conferences to publications, is wholly focused on improving safety in excavation through collaboration. At the center of all of these initiatives is you, damage prevention professional, and others like you in the industry. Because, at the end of the day, ESA doesn't employ any SUE experts, GPR specialists, or trenchless professionals. From Conference speakers, to Magazine authors, to Town Hall panelists, we rely on the diverse perspectives of industry experts. Our superpower is creating spaces and platforms for those perspectives to come together ‚Äî Places where discussions become collaboration and collaboration leads to solutions.","Technology Insights Settings

It is now commonly used to describe successful approaches to improving quality outcomes for older adults in communities, workplaces, health systems and other settings. Founded in 2019, the Age-Friendly Institute elevates those age-friendly initiatives and provides a first of its kind platform for capturing feedback about them from older adults: the consumer website www.AgeFriendly.com. Working with our partners around the world, we harness what we learn when we listen to the voices of older adults to inform continuous age-friendly program improvement and accelerate enhanced quality of life and care for older adults.","Technology Insights Settings

Often, stuff simply falls through the cracks, and teams cannot follow up on everything. Companies working directly with customers, patients, and passengers suffer the most. Problems with staffing, shift scheduling, and even basic household items, such as unexpected mess in the restroom... Businesses are simply unaware of some service problems that are screaming to their customers. Statistically, 2% of customers leave their reviews on social networks. Many of them hurt the company's reputation for no reason: all the business needed was to help ""shine the light"" on the problem to fix it quickly.","Technology Insights Settings

All solutions are featured on their website and available to Responders nationwide in largely populated communities to the most remote rural areas. These confidential resources provide services ranging from a peer-to-peer anonymous chat app available 24/7, a mental health tool to manage stress, and a wellness tool to combat the job-related burn-out. Responders and their family's wellbeing is too often compromised by the demands of their job and weighs heavily on the communities they serve. The statistics are alarming and the need for solutions is enormous. - EMS personnel report suicidal thoughts at a rate 10X the national average. - Journal of Emergency Medical Services - The average life expectancy for Law Enforcement Officers is 57 years old compared to 79 for civilians. - Sigma Tactical Wellness - Did you know 70% of the U.S. fire service is volunteer?- Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration This work is clearly groundbreaking as no other entity has assembled a collection of resources of this significance, in one place. All Clear Foundation (ACF) is a ""by Responder/for Responder"" organization that is changing the dialog of Responder health. ACF believes that diversity only makes Agencies stronger and more able to serve communities. The Responder communities served by ACF include: ‚Ä¢ Law Enforcement ‚Ä¢ Fire ‚Ä¢ EMS ‚Ä¢ Dispatch ‚Ä¢ Frontline Medical Workers ‚Ä¢ Ski Patrol ‚Ä¢ Disaster Responders ‚Ä¢ Crisis Counselors ‚Ä¢ Corrections ‚Ä¢ Coroners/Last Responders ‚Ä¢ Wildland Firefighters ‚Ä¢ Other Responders By making health and wellness tools available to Responders and families, ACF has formidably initiated a movement that will steadily steer communities locally and nationally towards a healthier populace.","Technology Insights Settings

Try Apruve today. Our Mission: To enable large global enterprises to automate financed credit programs to deliver transformative change. Our Story: In 2013 Apruve set out to disrupt the way credit and A/R have always been done by putting technology, human talent and lending resources together differently. Our mission is to enable transformative change in global enterprises through automated, financed credit programs. Simplicity is our watchword, because we've found that eliminating the unnecessary in business-to-business transactions is in the best interest of our customers, our lenders, and the people they serve. We believe that A/R automation will continue to march forward toward automated invoice financing ‚Äì especially for channels (eCommerce), markets (international) or customers (long-tail) where a hands-off approach makes more sense and generates and maximizes ROI for the enterprise.","Technology Insights Settings

Experience advanced monitoring and seamless operations. Avada Software builds, sells and supports Infrared360, a comprehensive J2EE compliant Enterprise Messaging management and monitoring portal enabling secure, delegated access to WebSphere MQ, WebSphere Business (Broker) Integrator, WebSphere Application Server (others on planned), TIBCO/EMS, other JMS based enterprise middleware infrastructures, as well as any Web Service interface. We call this broad-based capability ""The Internet of Relevant Things""‚Ñ¢ as it allows enterprises to engage in cloud-based and BYOD device initiatives particular to their needs with confidence and security. The solution is Agentless. There is no deployment to managed servers where the middleware runs, and no support overhead for changes to agents or for changes to operating systems on which they run. Infrared360 provides remote administration, real time monitoring, infrastructure message testing, scheduling, auditing, and reporting all under one security model. Infrared360 has a built-in SOA engine allowing customers to leverage their SOA initiatives with external (or internal) services, all as part of the portal. Customers report 40% operating efficiency improvement when using Infrared360 vs other products formerly used for middleware administration, monitoring, and reporting! Top companies in banking, finance, insurance, airlines, pharmaceuticals and others using IR360 have realized significant ROI of 3-6 months and realigning costly staff resources for higher productivity.

And it's uncomfortable. The system, the people, and the organization itself are fighting to remain the same. Those words are from our founders' book, Chief Optimization Officer: Shattering the Status Quo. And while BecomeMore's founders spent years enabling other companies to raise the bar and level up, they realized that they needed to apply the same standards and principles to their own organizations. And so, in the fall of 2020 they began their own optimization journey to level up their organizational resources in order to enhance their customer's results. It wasn't easy. It was often uncomfortable. It required vision, courage, hard work, and tenacity. And on January 1, 2023 ‚Äì these five companies had very different histories, experiences, processes, people, perspectives, and leaders ‚Äì merged to BecomeMore. -We're proud of the journey we've taken. -We're pleased with the results of our hard work. -We're thrilled that we've been able to grow our team, expand our services, and develop new products. -We're honored to continue to serve our long-term clients. -And we look forward to discovering how we can support other organizations on their optimization and transformation journey!","Technology Insights Settings

BenchSights provides a software & analytics platform for benchmarking SaaS businesses. BenchSights founder & CEO, David Spitz built the Pacific Crest/KeyBanc SaaS Survey, over a twelve-year period, and learned firsthand the power of benchmarking. Pacific Crest was amply rewarded, participating in virtually every SaaS IPO in those early years. David also realized that traditional benchmarking is painful! It has all the telltale signs of a business opportunity: manual processes, ill-suited survey tools, spreadsheets, static reports, etc. With BenchSights, we have created a new software and data platform which fixes, automates, and redefines how benchmarking works, creating significant value for our partners and customers and the industries they serve.

We have a national network of over 35,000 lawyers who are poised to serve our clients through our four streams of business. These include: 1. Secondments (Engagements) where we provide a cost-effective solution and our lawyers work for our clients who have staffing gaps due to parental or medical leaves, restructurings, hiring freezes and a host of other reasons. 2. ""Extended Interviews"" where our lawyers work on engagements for our clients and if the clients and lawyers like each other, the clients can elect to hire our lawyers. 3. Strategic Partnerships (Industry Collaborations) where we partner with a full range of innovative legal service providers and deploy all levels of talent to support staffing in the legal industry. 4. Direct Hires (Recruiting) where we offer more traditional recruiting services for direct hire placements without a retainer requirement and provide access to our deep talent pool helping our clients create a more diverse workforce.

Boredroom Breakouts unique approach helps boardrooms break out to develop courage, mental agility, resilience + creativity, empowering you to push boundaries to reach your full potential. How great would it be to use FUN to drive business revenue and growth, while being confidently aware that SCIENCE drives the methods? Through a variety of innovative + engaging experiences, we partner with organizations to help humans human better together long term. We believe that engagement is driven by biological factors, triggered by core fears. We believe that we know ""what"" we are supposed to do, but when our fears are triggered, we often revert to avoiding hard conversations and decisions. We get comfortable and maybe even a little...BORED. Workplaces often see this reflected in really nice & great people that struggle to navigate past meeting group think, lack of initiative and innovation, little follow through, low engagement and contribution to solutions, turnover, and ultimately, lack of significant progress. If you are ready for REAL change to happen, that's really scary for a lot of people. The goal isn't to change each other, it is to change together. So here's what we will do together: 1. Learn the science surrounding the core fears that all humans share that hold us back from our greatest potential. 2. Build frameworks that create and communicate a consistent culture of psychological safety and clarity surrounding success and failure so that your team ALWAYS wins. 3. Integrate low-stress ongoing experiences to communicate, practice, and grow your team's skills to empower their ability to navigate fear and change with confidence. We can't wait to help you put the FUN in FUNctional as you build a stronger, more agile, better version of your team. Visit www.boredroombreakouts.com to see how you can empower an unstoppable team that thrives through change and drives business growth.","Technology Insights Settings

Since the start of the Covid-19 Pandemic in March 2020, our economy has taken a drastic turn. From thousands of businesses being forced to shut down, to labor shortages causing a global supply-chain nightmare, businesses are struggling to both get rid of and buy furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E). As a result, businesses are left having to throw away perfectly functional equipment, causing our landfills to fill up even more rapidly, and leaving new businesses without the resources they need to function. With Bulkk's innovative platform, businesses who need to get rid of FF&E, whether they are shutting down, moving, or don't need their equipment for any reason, can now list their items for other businesses to purchase. Not only does this help businesses get their equipment off their back, but it enables new businesses to have easy access to discounted materials and stops perfectly good FF&E from going to landfills. Our team is dedicated to helping your business either liquidate FF&E or connect you with other businesses' equipment. Let's work together and help solve an urgent global supply chain issue, reduce waste, and ultimately increase sustainable business practices.","Technology Insights Settings

C&R was founded by the Restoration Industry Association more than four decades ago, as a member-only benefit. In July 2021, C&R became the only independently-owned B2B magazine serving restorers after being acquired by Blueprint Creative, a publishing company owned and operated by ongoing industry media partner, Michelle Blevins. Today, C&R is available in print and digital formats for free, to the entire industry. This also opens up access to a library of historical content from early industry pioneers. As part of the refreshed C&R, a new industry resource website is now live at www.candrmagazine.com. This new website will include magazine articles, web-exclusive content, new podcasts and videos, the latest industry news, an up-to-date events calendar, and more. Blevins has been part of the restoration industry since 2015, and is endlessly passionate about bringing high quality educational content of all kinds to contractors, through the expertise of industry educators, thought leaders, trainers, and peers. She lives in Metro Detroit with her husband and two sons.","Technology Insights Settings

Captains Club is more than just an executive search firm; we are the next logical partner in the evolution of your business. Our expertise is collaborating with pioneering companies like yours to prepare, attract, qualify and hire the right executive to unlock your business' potential. In short, we ensure that your company has the leadership in place to drive growth and pursue its purpose. As for you - you'll gain the freedom you need to get back to driving vision, innovation and culture; while your Captain orchestrates and empowers the team. Don't let the fear of handing over the wheel hold you back from achieving greatness - having an experienced Captain at the helm will transform your business into a force to be reckoned with. The world has changed forever, your business needs a leader in place who is less about the role and more about the goal. Using less committed vendors to install the wrong candidate on your leadership team can undo years worth of brand equity, employee trust, and industry relationships. When the time comes to step away from day-to-day department operations and focus your attention on big-picture decisions, you need a right-hand in place that you can trust to be as invested in your business' success as you are.
